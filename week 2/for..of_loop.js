// The for...of loop in JavaScript is used to iterate over iterable
//  objects like arrays, strings, maps, sets, and other objects that implement the iterable protocol.
//   It allows you to loop through the values of the iterable, making it concise and easy to use compared to traditional loops.

let name="my name is nabin basnet";

for(let letter of name){
    console.log(letter);
